    image: "IBD_protein_structure.png",
    details: "This Big Data Spokes Project aims to speed our understanding of genetic variants that are suspected of causing disease by instantly showing researchers a 3D model of the chemical effect of each variant. Because determining these effects is currently a laborious process requiring specialized skills, it is often not done in research on genetic variants. Here, we present a study of the genetic causes of inflammatory bowel disease, and show how our resource could have been employed to make the study faster and cheaper. ",
